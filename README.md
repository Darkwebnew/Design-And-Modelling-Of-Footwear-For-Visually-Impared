## 🧠 Overview

**Smart Footwear Assistive Walking System** is an innovative IoT-based assistive technology designed to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals. The system integrates ultrasonic sensors, haptic feedback mechanisms, and intelligent processing to detect obstacles and provide real-time alerts during navigation.

This project combines **embedded systems**, **IoT connectivity**, and **assistive technology** to create an affordable, compact, and user-friendly solution that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday footwear.

### Key Highlights:

- ✅ Real-time obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors
- ✅ Haptic feedback through vibration motors
- ✅ Arduino-based embedded control system
- ✅ Portable and wearable design
- ✅ Low-power consumption
- ✅ Scalable for future IoT enhancements

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in detecting obstacles at ground level and mid-height during daily navigation. Traditional assistive devices like white canes have limitations:

- ⚠️ Limited detection range
- ⚠️ Cannot detect overhead obstacles
- ⚠️ Requires constant physical contact with surfaces
- ⚠️ Reactive rather than proactive warning system

Our project addresses these gaps by providing:

- ✅ Hands-free operation
- ✅ Proactive obstacle alerts
- ✅ Enhanced spatial awareness
- ✅ Comfortable and discreet wearable technology

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The Smart Footwear system operates on a simple yet effective principle:

1. **Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) mounted on the footwear emit ultrasonic waves
2. **Measurement**: Sensors calculate distance to obstacles based on echo return time
3. **Processing**: Arduino Nano processes distance data in real-time
4. **Alert**: When obstacles are within threshold distance, vibration motors activate
5. **Feedback**: User receives haptic feedback proportional to obstacle proximity

### Distance Thresholds:

```cpp
if (distance < 20 cm)  → Strong vibration
if (distance < 40 cm)  → Medium vibration
if (distance < 60 cm)  → Weak vibration
if (distance > 60 cm)  → No vibration
```
